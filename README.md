# 🎯 Digit Recognition System (ML + Flask + AWS ECS)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a digit recognition system powered by a trained CNN model.
Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the system predicts the digit along with a confidence score.

🌐 Live Deployment: https://digician.solusian.com/

⚠️ Access Restriction:
Only users with email addresses using the `csmu.ac.in` domain are allowed to log in.  
All other email domains are restricted unless explicitly whitelisted.


The system includes:

* Modular ML pipeline (training and inference)
* Flask-based web application
* Supabase authentication (OTP / magic link)
* Deployment on AWS ECS with Application Load Balancer and SSL

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔢 Digit Prediction

* CNN model (`mnist_cnn.keras`)
* Outputs:

  * Predicted digit
  * Confidence score
  * Inversion flag (if preprocessing was applied)

---

### 🔐 Authentication

* Supabase OTP (magic link login)
* Domain-based access control:

  * `csmu.ac.in` → allowed
  * Gmail → restricted to whitelisted users

## 🔄 ML Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

* Loads dataset
* Splits into training and test sets
* Saves to `artifacts/`

### 2. Data Transformation

* Preprocessing and scaling

### 3. Model Training

* Trains CNN model
* Saves model:

```
artifacts/mnist_cnn.keras
```
